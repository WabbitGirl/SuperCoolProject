Hello! Glad to see my homework repo is still being used. Maybe check out some of the other garbage I have kicking around on here?

Pro tips for getting an A in Dr.Cerny's class. 

    1. Study those 200 slide powerpoints like the bible
    2. When studying go for understanding the content, not memorizing
    3. Master git and design patterns. 
    4. You dont realize it now, but java streams are king. 
  
  Do me a favor, if everyone here can tell Professor Fry congradulations on retirement, im sure she would be very greatful.

Guys im having second thoughts, this might not be as cool as I thought.
